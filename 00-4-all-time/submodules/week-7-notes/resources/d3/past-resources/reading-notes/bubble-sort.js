/*
-Bubble Sort is almost never a good choice in production
    -It is not efficient
    -it is not common
    -there is a negative stigma attached to using it.
    
-When someone writes that an item in a collection "bubbles up this means:
    -The item is in motion
    -The item is moving in some direction
    -The item has some final resting destination
    
! When invoking Bubble Sort to sort an array of integers in ascending order;
! The largest integers will "bubble up" to the "top"( the end ) of the array... one at a time.

* As the algorithm iterates through the array... it compares each element to the element 's right neighbor. 
    *If the current element is larger than its neighbor, the algorithm swaps them. 
        *This continues until all elements in the array are sorted.
-How does a pass of Bubble Sort work ?
