assessment for this lesson.

1. Given HTML that includes `<div id=”catch-me-if-you-can”>HI!</div>`, write a
   JavaScript statement that stores a reference to the HTMLDivElement with the
   id “catch-me-if-you-can” in a variable named “divOfInterest”.
2. Given HTML that includes seven SPAN elements each with the class “cloudy”,
   write a JavaScript statement that stores a reference to a NodeList filled
   with references to the seven HTMLSpanElements in a variable named
   “cloudySpans”.
3. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY elements, create and
   reference a JS file that in which the JavaScript will create and attach to
   the BODY element an H1 element with the id "sleeping-giant" with the content
   "Jell-O, Burled!".
4. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with the
   SCRIPT's SRC attribute referencing an empty JS file, write a script in the JS
   file to create a DIV element with the id "lickable-frog" and add it as the
   last child to the BODY element.
5. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with no
   SRC attribute on the SCRIPT element, write a script in the SCRIPT block to
   create a UL element with no id, create an LI element with the id
   "dreamy-eyes", add the LI as a child to the UL element, and add the UL
   element as the first child of the BODY element.
6. Write JavaScript to add the CSS class "i-got-loaded" to the BODY element when
   the window fires the DOMContentLoaded event.
7. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-best-friend" that has
   six non-empty LIs as its children, write JavaScript to write the content of
   each LI to the console.
8. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-worst-enemy" that has
   no children, write JavaScript to construct a string that contains six LI tags
   each containing a random number and set the inner HTML property of
   ul#your-worst-enemy to that string.
9. Write JavaScript to update the title of the document to the current time at a
   reasonable interval such that it looks like a real clock.
