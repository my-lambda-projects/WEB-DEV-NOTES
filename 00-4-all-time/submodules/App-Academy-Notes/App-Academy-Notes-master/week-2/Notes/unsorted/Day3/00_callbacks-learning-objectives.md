# Callbacks Learning Objectives

Below is a complete list of the terminal learning objectives for this lesson.
When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the
following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the
assessment for this lesson.

1. Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First
   Class Objects” in JavaScript.
2. Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and
   multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed
3. Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should
   return the result of the callback that is greater.
4. Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments.
   The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#map`.
5. Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as
   arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#filter`.
6. Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as
   arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#every`.
