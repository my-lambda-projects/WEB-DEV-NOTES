# Object Exercises
________________________________________________________________________________

It's time to get some practice using Objects! Below we've included a link to
download a `zip` file for a number of problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified. You should have `mocha` installed
and will need to pass all the tests in order to move on.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you
downloaded and then navigate into the directory for that file. Once there you
can run the command:

```sh
~ mocha
```

The `mocha` command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this
don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!
